                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi there! I'm a legal tech newbie with a passion for using technology to improve legal processes. I'm excited to 
                    showcase my work and skills on this portfolio website. But before that, let me give you a little background story about myself.</p>
                <article>
                    As a recent graduate of the University of Ilorin with a bachelor's degree in Common and Islamic law (combined law), I found myself drawn to the world of legal technology. I was fascinated by the potential of technology to solve problems in the legal profession, and I knew that this was where I wanted to focus my career.
                    However, I quickly realized that my knowledge of law alone was not enough to make an impact in legal tech. I needed to learn new skills, particularly in programming languages, in order to truly make a difference. I embarked on a self-study journey to learn programming languages, but I soon found that it was not enough. I needed a structured learning environment, with guidance and mentorship, to truly make progress.
                    That's when I discovered the TIIDELab Prefellowship 3.0 program. The program offered a comprehensive curriculum in tech, with a focus on legal tech, and provided the structure and guidance I needed to succeed. I knew that this was the perfect opportunity for me to transition into tech and achieve my goal of solving problems in the legal profession.
                    I joined the program with a sense of excitement and determination, eager to learn as much as I could. Over the course of the program, I successfully learned HTML and CSS, and I am now looking forward to diving into JavaScript. This milestone is a major achievement for me, and it has given me the confidence to pursue even more ambitious goals in the future.
                    I am thrilled to see what other things I get to accomplish in the future, thanks to the knowledge and skills I have gained through the TIIDELab Prefellowship 3.0 program. With a strong foundation in both law and tech, I am confident that I can make a meaningful impact in the legal tech industry and help drive innovation and progress in the years to come</article>    
                <p>When I'm not tinkering with legal tech, I enjoy spending time with loved ones, reading, board games and trying new recipes.</p>
